Thanks for stopping by! I've set up this space to share thoughts, insights, and reflections on the topics I'm most passionate about.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about the areas I work in and care about, including:

- **AI Technologies** — From responsible AI and assurance frameworks to practical applications of machine learning
- **Innovation & R&D** — Lessons learned from taking ideas from research concept to commercial product
- **Systems Engineering** — Approaches to modelling, simulation, and managing complexity in large-scale systems
- **Digital Twins** — The evolving landscape of digital twin technology and its real-world applications
- **Healthcare Technology** — How technology is transforming healthcare delivery

## Why Blog?

I believe in learning in public and sharing knowledge openly. Writing helps me clarify my thinking, and I hope some of these posts might be useful to others working in similar spaces.

Stay tuned for more — and feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/callumcockburn) if you'd like to discuss any of these topics.
